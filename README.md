# Sample use case of Playwright Web Testing & Automation Framework

This is an example case of Playwright usage to test a news website, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

## Instructions

Install the project by running:

```
npm i
```

To run the project with web server:

```
npm run start
```

To generate a new snapshot run:
```
npm run generateSnapShot
```

All tests are within `/tests` folder and can be run using
```
npm run test
```
or 
```
npm run test-debug
```

I recommend using VSCode with Playwright installed. For guides on how to install Playwright in VSCode and run tests with their extension, please see [playwright instalation guides](https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode)
